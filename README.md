This is a simple demo of a higher order component that manages observable state subscriptions based on Mike Ryan's @ngrx/component presentation. The higher order component 'Statefulness' is responsible for managing state observables subscriptions, removing async pipes from the templates and possibly removing zone.js entirely once Ivy's markDirty API becomes stable.
